Parser 3.0
----------

    1) Switch back to using a distinction between complete and incomplete replays
    2) WR::Parser needs to be replaced with the current WR::Game; move the parser and
       it's version-dependent stuff back into a low-level role.


    
    Perhaps wrap the actual replay unpacking, decrypting, and stream into a WR::Parser::File object that has
    the required logic and enables some non-blocking methodologies.

   
    Current Game.pm needs to use the data in the replay, and not the battle result as the primary source.
    Battle result data only gets added after the entire thing has ran it's course.
