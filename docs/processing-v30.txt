Processing v3.0
---------------

See parser-v30.txt for parser changes required for this to work

    switch the processing to non-blocking mode and swap the process daemon to this:

    - 'master' daemon sits and listens on a thunderpush channel for upload notifications, an upload notification
      will just trigger a check for new jobs that need processed.

      jobs are pushed on an internal queue

    - master will loop the queue using a recurring timer, and if there are less workers active than th maximum,
      will fork itself off and exec() the single-file processor that gets passed the job ID to handle. 


    push messages:

        source              target      evt                 data            desc
