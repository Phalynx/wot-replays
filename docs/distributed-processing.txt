Distributed processing scratchpad
---------------------------------

must-have features:

    -   fail-safe, e.g. if a slave has not processed a replay within a set amount of time
        (or has not reported progress in a certain amount of time) consider that process job
        failed, and re-queue it for another slave to work on
    -   slaves must authenticate using a specific token, and must originate a connection
        from a specific IP address

protocol:
    HTTP? Or something custom?
