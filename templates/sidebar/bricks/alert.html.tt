		    <p>8.10 has been released on EU and NA (as far as I can tell), but not yet on SEA. Since I require files from the game client to update the parser and all the other related data, I've not yet been able to update the site. As soon as 8.10 is released in SEA I'll be able to update. </p>
		    <p>Until the site can be updated, 8.10 replay can not be uploaded - so hold on to them until 8.10 hits SEA which will be soon(tm).</p>
